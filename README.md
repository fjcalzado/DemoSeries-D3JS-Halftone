### D3JS Halftone Simulator

Example of D3.js usage to render a simulation of halftone printing patterns.
Halftone is a reprographic technique that simulates continuous tone imagery through the use of dots, varying its properties like size, shape or pattern.
This project is also intended to find out D3.js limits in terms of performance and DOM intensive access operations.
