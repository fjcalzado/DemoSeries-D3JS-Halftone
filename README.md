# Halftone Simulator

Complete webb app to render halftone printing patterns based in D3.js.
Halftone is a reprographic technique that simulates continuous tone imagery through the use of dots, varying its properties like size, shape or pattern.
This project is also intended to find out D3.js limits in terms of performance due to DOM intensive access operations.
